# Tech Report

### StockTwits (result.csv, result_sample.sql):
We collected this data from StockTwits, a social media platform designed for sharing stock sentiments and ideas between investors. Stocktwits has an API that retrieves posts with a Developer account. We retrieved data using the stocktwits RESTful API. This API doesn’t require a Python wrapper so we used curl commands like the following: curl -X GET https://api.stocktwits.com/api/2/streams/symbol/TSLA.json -o output.txt for now This api gives us access to many StockTwits features such as ticker, user streams, message, sentiment, timestamp...StockTwits is a reputable source given that many of the contributors are reputable investors. We are not trying to find accurate information about stock prices. We are trying to collect sentiment, and given StockT	wits’ niche mission as a platform for retail traders we are confident that there will be correlation between sentiment and Stocktwits posts. We repeated api requests to create a sample since we can only retrieve 30 stocks at once which was an obstacle when preprocessing. In order to overcome this, we want to automate this process for the remainder of the project. We have 30 rows of sample data.These have attributes to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment. 30 rows represents a sample, and keeping collecting data based on the same attributes will be enough. The missing values we have are in the basic sentiment section, which gives a shortcut of understanding sentiment of a post without having to dive too deep in parsing text. However, for various reasons people can choose not to put a sentiment. This can create a challenge since we’ll have to predict sentiment from those posts, instead of knowing instantly. There are no duplicates since each post has a unique id. They are skewed since there are a lot more comments with the basic sentiment column “Bullish” which is an investing term for having a positive outlook on a stock.


### Russell and Tesla Stock Data (data.db, data.db sample):
The data for Russell3000 is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ERUA/history/) (the raw data from the link can be found in Russell3000.csv) and the data for Tesla stock is collected from [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/historical) (the raw data from the link can be found in Tesla.csv). These sources are reputable and provided the most accessible information that met our data collection needs. 
The data sample was generated by using the an [sqlite viewer](http://sqliteviewer.flowsoft7.com) and retrieving the first ten rows of each table. The sample is comparatively small but sufficiently represents the format of the complete dataset. It is not likely to exhibit sampling bias.  
The data is cleaned so that dates are formatted the same way for both stocks. Additionally, unnecessary symbols such as ‘$’ are removed from the data. A part of the data that is not as clean is many of the RussellVolume inputs are 0. 
There are 505 rows in the tesla_stock_data table, 479 rows in the russell_stock_data table, and 479 rows in the combined_stock_data table. Days where russell_stock_data was not available were omitted from the combined_stock_data table as the data is only valuable to us so that we can compare the relative prices of the funds, so data for both stocks needs to be available for the day to be a useful data point. This data represents two years (2019, 2020) worth of information which should be sufficient for the analysis stage. There is no duplicate data in the tables since each row represents a unique day in the time frame. 
There were no significant challenges in this stage of the data collection. We look forward to using this data as a comparison metric. Russell 3000 will be used to represent the general market, and will serve as a benchmark comparison value for drawing conclusions about Tesla stock performance.
