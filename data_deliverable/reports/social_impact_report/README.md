# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

### Socio-Historical Context ###
The major stakeholders in this project include stakeholders in the observed funds (Tesla and Russell 3000), social media users whose data we collect from StockTwits or Twitter, and those employed by Tesla, since ability to understand the relationship between social media use and stock price could affect social perception and ultimately profitability of their company. Depending on the results of our analysis, stakeholders and Tesla employees could either be benefited or harmed by our results. We expect the results to be neutral for social media users whose data we collect. 

In the report “The Influence of Media on Tesla’s Stock Price,” a separate research group attempted to explore the correlation between social media/news and stock price of Tesla. However, one of their concluding points is that tweets/likes are not good predictors of stock price, and they found only weak correlations between tweet sentiment and trading volume (“The Influence of Media on Tesla’s Stock Price”). Because of these largely indeterminant results, socio-historical impact of their research seems negligible. As we hope to have more conclusive/helpful results than the aforementioned project, their socio-historical impact is not helpful in informing our research’s potential impact. 

The above analysis of socio-historical factors allows us to frame our research question and methods in a socially informed manner. It is important that we frame our research question clearly so that our results are not misinterpreted or extrapolated, as this could have negative consequences for shareholders or employees. We should analyze our data with the understanding that we have collected real users’ thoughts that they have not given us express consent to study. Additionally, we must assume responsibility for interpreting our findings as clearly and accurately as possible to avoid causing inaccurate and negative consequences. Finally, we must ensure that we present our numerical results alongside context, and make the shortcomings of our findings clear. We must include information about how it is appropriate for our conclusions to be applied.

### Ethical Considerations

A bias present in the Tesla stock data is psychological bias. As pointed out in the article “The Psychology Roiling Tesla’s Stock Price,” analyst price targets for Tesla stock vary by nearly $300. Because of this wide range in targets from experts in the field, confirmation bias is prevalent--people can easily find an analyst who supports their view of whether or not the stock is priced appropriately (Shefrin). Shefrin attributes much of this variation to questionable assumptions made by analysts, mostly because of different analytic forecasting tools producing different results for target prices. 
Media also has a large role in influencing Tesla stock prices. This can introduce bias into stock price as media attention (views, likes, reposts) are not necessarily representative of the general population or shareholder’s opinions on Tesla stock valuation. 
It is difficult to think about how this bias can be mitigated with respect to collecting stock price information, as the bias is embedded in the information. However, social media bias can be mitigated in other parts of the data collection process, such as making attempts to collect Twitter data about Tesla stock that is representative of the general population, and the general population of shareholders. This could be difficult to do as demographic information is not readily available about Twitter users, and collecting this information could be viewed as an invasion of privacy. Because of these concerns, this bias mitigation approach has not been employed in our project. 

Some biases that may exist in the interpretation of our data could be the way missing russell stock data is dealt with. Important information may be embedded in the 25 days where data was not available, however, it is most likely that this will have a negligible impact on the analysis stage of the project. 

Individual privacy may be affected by the aggregation of data collected from Twitter and StockTwits. Although individuals have not consented directly to our collection of their social media contributions, the data is publicly available to view and collect via APIs. We do not expect any of our data collection to have negative implications for users, as it is not particularly personal information and our analysis has an ethically sound purpose. Additionally, by considering possible negative impacts, we find ways to reduce negative side effects of our data collection. 

A possible misinterpretation of our project results could be extrapolation. Our project is a hypothesis testing project, and thus its conclusions may not hold in the future. This is important to keep in mind when interpreting and finding uses for our results.
